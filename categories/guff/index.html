    <p>There I was, minding my own business… Casually scrolling down my Twitter feed when I noticed a post from <a href="https://twitter.com/TheColonial">OJ</a>, entitled <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/The-ins-and-outs-of-HTTP-and-HTTPS-communications-in-Meterpreter-and-Metasploit-Stagers">The ins and outs of HTTP and HTTPS communications in Meterpreter and Metasploit Stagers</a>. A bit of a mouthful, it summerises the difference between the WinInet and WinHTTP API’s and what that means for Meterpreter.</p>

    <p>As some may be aware, in January 2015 I started the SANS &lsquo;<a href="http://www.sans.org/selfstudy/course/web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking">SEC542: Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking</a>&rsquo; SelfStudy course.  I passed the GWAPT (GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester) certification at the end of May; so I figured I would write up a review of the course and summerise my experience.</p>

    <p>At the very moment I am typing this, ~4 hours remain on the countdown clock for <a href="http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html">VulnHub&rsquo;s Sokar Competition</a>.  We have also received about 17 complete write-ups, which I&rsquo;m really pleased with.</p>

<p>Now, Sokar was never originally designed to be released on VulnHub, let alone feature as a birthday competition.  So this post serves to outline Sokar&rsquo;s origin story, the intended exploitation path and anything else I can think to talk about.</p>

    <p>Offensive Security are launching a new Virtual Penetration Testing Lab, dubbed <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/offensive-security-solutions/virtual-penetration-testing-labs">The Playground</a>.</p>

<p>For those who have already taken an Offensive Security course (e.g. PWK), you will already be familiar with the types of machines in the lab - mainly various flavours of Linux and Windows.  The Playground is even more versatile and also includes Citrix, Windows AD Domains, SCADA, IPS and anti-virus.</p>

<p>I was incredibly lucky and was offered the chance to join the private beta program for testing the Playground; which involved attacking as many of the machines as possible and providing appropriate feedback to Offensive Security.  The intricate details of the lab will obviously remain private, but we were permitted to publish this final review of our experience.</p>

<p>So without further ado&hellip;</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s been about a month since Kvasir I was made available on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kvasir-i,106/">VulnHub</a>, so I thought I would write a follow-up post about it.  In some ways, it was a vulnerable VM which went in a different direction to the ones we are used to.  It was also the first VM I have produced, so I wanted to jot down a few notes about what I thought worked well and what didn&rsquo;t.</p>
